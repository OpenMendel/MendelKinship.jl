 80 SNPS HAVE BEEN REMOVED
 SINCE THEIR MINOR ALLELE FREQUENCY WAS NOT IN THE DESIRED RANGE.

 IN THE FIRST FILTERING STAGE, NO INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED,
 AS NONE HAD A GENOTYPE SUCCESS RATE LESS THAN 0.980

 NO INPUT SNPS WERE REMOVED,
 AS NONE HAD A GENOTYPE SUCCESS RATE LESS THAN 0.980

 IN THE SECOND FILTERING STAGE, NO INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED,
 AS NONE HAD A GENOTYPE SUCCESS RATE LESS THAN 0.980

 A TOTAL OF 80 SNPS WERE REMOVED DUE TO FILTERING CRITERIA.
 A TOTAL OF 18920 SNPS WILL BE ANALYZED.

 A TOTAL OF 462 INDIVIDUALS WITH SNP DATA WILL BE ANALYZED.
